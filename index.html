              >Ender's Game is a 1985 military science fiction novel</strong
            >
            by American author Orson Scott Card. Set at an unspecified date in
            Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two
            conflicts with an insectoid alien species they dub
            <em>"the buggers"</em>. In preparation for an anticipated third
            invasion, Earth's international military force recruits young
            children, including the novel's protagonist, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin,
            to be trained as elite officers. The children learn military
            strategy and leadership by playing increasingly difficult war games,
            including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is
            revealed.<br /><br />The book originated as a short story of the
            same name, published in the August 1977 issue of Analog Science
            Fiction and Fact. The novel was published on January 15, 1985.
            Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the
            novel, Card wrote additional books in the Ender's Game series. Card
            released an updated version of Ender's Game in 1991, changing some
            political facts to account for the then-recent dissolution of the
            Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The novel has been
            translated into 34 languages. In the movie adaptation and novels
            after the original sequels, "buggers" are referred to as
            "Formics".<br /><br />Reception of the book has been largely
            positive. It has become suggested reading for military organizations
            such as the United States Marine Corps. Ender's Game was recognized
            as "best novel" by the 1985 Nebula Award and the 1986 Hugo Award[4]
            in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. Its four
            sequels—Speaker for the Dead (1986), Xenocide (1991), Children of
            the Mind (1996), and Ender in Exile (2008)—follow Ender's subsequent
            travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the
            later novella A War of Gifts (2007) and novel Ender's Shadow (1999),
            plus other novels in the Shadow saga, take place during the same
            time period as the original.<br /><br />A film adaptation of the
            same name, written for the screen and directed by Gavin Hood, and
            starring Asa Butterfield as Ender, was released in October 2013.
            Card co-produced the film. The novel has also been adapted into two
            comic book series

          <h3>Film:</h3>
          <p>
            After several years of speculation on the possibility, Summit
            Entertainment financed and coordinated the development of a film in
            2011, serving as its distributor. Gavin Hood directed the film,
            which lasts 1 hour and 54 minutes. Filming began in New Orleans,
            Louisiana, on February 27, 2012, and was released on November 1,
            2013 (USA). A movie preview trailer was released in May 2013 and a
            second trailer was released later that year.<br /><br />Card has
            called Ender's Game <em>"unfilmable"</em>, "because everything takes
            place in Ender's head", and refused to sign a film deal unless he
            could ensure that the film was "true to the story". Of the film that
            he eventually agreed to, Card said it was "the best that good people
            could do with a story they really cared about and believed in", and
            while warning fans not to expect a completely faithful adaptation,
            called the film "damn good".<br /><br />
            The movie starred Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin and Harrison Ford
            as Colonel Hyrum Graff.

          <h3>Video Game:</h3>
          <p>
            In 2008, it was announced an Ender's Game video game was in the
            works. It was to be known as Ender's Game: Battle Room and was a
            planned digitally distributed video game for all viable downloadable
            platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which
            also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games Undertow and Shadow
            Complex. Chair had sold the licensing of Empire to Card, which
            became a bestselling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save
            its setting in the Ender universe and that it would have focused on
            the Battle Room. <br /><br />
            In December 2010, it was announced that the video game development
            had stopped and the project put on indefinite hold.
            <br /><br />
            Orson Scott Card and Amaze Entertainment also came to an agreement
            regarding a video game adaption of the novel but nothing ever
            materialized.
